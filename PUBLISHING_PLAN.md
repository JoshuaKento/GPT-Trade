- [ ] Add new files to git (edgar/client_new.py, edgar/config_manager.py, etc.)
- [ ] Clean git status to show only intended files

### 2. Package Configuration Enhancement
Update `pyproject.toml` with additional PyPI metadata:
- [ ] Add `readme = "README.md"`
- [ ] Add `homepage` URL
- [ ] Add `repository` URL
- [ ] Add `keywords` for discoverability
- [ ] Add `classifiers` for Python versions and topics

### 3. Code Quality Assurance
- [ ] Run all tests: `python -m pytest tests/ -v`
- [ ] Verify console scripts work correctly
- [ ] Test package imports and core functionality
- [ ] Check for any linting issues

### 4. Documentation Review
- [ ] Ensure README.md covers installation and basic usage
- [ ] Verify all example code works
- [ ] Check that all referenced files exist
- [ ] Review API documentation completeness

### 5. Security & Compliance
- [ ] Remove any hardcoded credentials or sensitive data
- [ ] Verify SEC compliance features are documented
- [ ] Check that rate limiting is properly implemented

## Publishing Process

### Step 1: Build Package
```bash
# Install build tools
pip install build twine

# Build the package
python -m build
```

### Step 2: Test on TestPyPI
```bash
# Upload to TestPyPI first
python -m twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*

# Test installation from TestPyPI
pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ edgar-tools
```

### Step 3: Publish to PyPI
```bash
# Upload to production PyPI
python -m twine upload dist/*
```

### Step 4: Post-Publishing
- [ ] Create GitHub release with changelog
- [ ] Update version to 0.1.1-dev for future development
- [ ] Announce on relevant channels
